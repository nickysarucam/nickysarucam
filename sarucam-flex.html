                <li><img src="sarucam-flex-pic-1.jpg"><p>My family are my biggest flexâ€”I'm really proud of them. They are always there to support me in whatever I do and guide me. When life gets tough, they're my go-to people, and their love are irreplaceable. They teach me important stuff, not just about school but about being a good person too. I feel lucky to have them because, to me, they're the best part of my story.</p></li>
                <li><img src="sarucam-flex-pic-2.jpg "><p>My friends. Having friends, I can bond with for more than 7 years and still counting, is definitely a flex. They are the ones that always cheer me up and that I can vent with.</p></li>
                <li><img src="sarucam-flex-pic-3.jpg "><p> I am proud being a member of Iglesia Ni Cristo. God's words guide me to be kind, faithful, and decent. Having a relationship with God encourages me to live comfortably in life. </p></li>
                <li><img src="sarucam-flex-pic-4.jpg "><p>My cousins. People say blood is thicker than water, and that is indeed true. Through ups and downs, we are always there, helping one another.</p></li>
                <li><img src="sarucam-flex-pic-5.jpg "><p>Flexing this guy for cheering me up especially in times of pandemic. He always made me smile.</p></li>
                <li><img src="sarucam-flex-pic-6.jpg "><p>Surviving high school with honors is something I am proud of. Being a high school student might be exhausting, but it is worthwhile to work for.</p></li>
